# Friend Finder
A compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The user responds to questions with values from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). When the survey is subitted, an exisiting user record closest to the user records is found and returned. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. The closest record is defined as the set with lowest absolute difference for all ten questions combined.
